## Setting up
To use this file, you must first have an account on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) and have to subscribe to this translation API called [MyMemory](https://rapidapi.com/translated/api/mymemory-translation-memory).
Once you have done this, open `creds.example.json`, rename it to `creds.json` and add your X-RapidAPI-Key + X-RapidAPI-Host. 

## Using
Using this file is as easy as:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

But you would need to edit some of the stuff in main.py, like tranlation language and text to be translated for example.
